# AWS S3 Basics Project 🌐
Hey there! Welcome to my **AWS S3 Basics** project! 🎉 This repo showcases my hands-on journey mastering Amazon S3—buckets, encryption, versioning, and even a static website. Stick around to see what I built! 👇

What’s This All About? 🤓
This project is from a 1-hour course where I leveled up my AWS skills! Here’s what I conquered:
- 🪣 Created and managed S3 buckets
- 🔒 Enabled encryption and access control
- ⏳ Set up versioning for files
- 📦 Explored storage classes and lifecycle rules
- 🌍 Hosted a static website on S3

By the end, I earned a shiny certificate! 🏆
